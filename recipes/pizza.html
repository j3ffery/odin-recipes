    <h3>Discription</h3>
    <p>
        Detroit Pizza
    </p>
    <p>
        It's hard to pinpoint exactly where this style of pizza originated (it's hotly debated) but many believe it started in the 1940s at Buddy's Rendezvous, which is now the very popular Detroit chain Buddy's Pizza. The recipe was based on a Sicilian style pizza — with a thick but airy dough, almost the consistency of focaccia bread.

            <li>8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese</li>

            <li>4 ounces mild Cheddar cheese</li>

    </p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start the dough: Pour water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Stir in yeast and sugar and let dissolve. Add bread flour, 2 teaspoons oil, and salt; knead until dough is very smooth, soft, and elastic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle remaining 1 teaspoon oil onto a 10x14-inch Detroit-style pizza pan; use your fingers to spread oil over the bottom of the pan. Place dough in the center of the pan. Oil your fingers, then pull and stretch dough into a rectangular shape. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, make the sauce: Bring marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F (274 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the toppings: Dice Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese into small cubes. Combine in a bowl and toss to mix. Set out pepperoni slices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finish the dough: Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan. Press out air from the dough while stretching and pushing it into a rectangle that goes all the way to the edges of the pan. Stretch dough up the sides about 1/2 inch or so.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lay almost all pepperoni slices onto dough. Scatter cheese cubes evenly over top, making sure to fully cover all the edges where dough meets the pan. Ladle sauce on top in three long strips. Arrange remaining pepperoni slices over top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is a bit darker than golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.
